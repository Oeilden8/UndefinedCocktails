# UndefinedCocktails
Projet 2 - Undefined Cocktails

This is my second group project coded during my formation at Wild Code School. The requirements were :
  - Using React
  - Using React Router
  - Making requests to a free REST API of our choice
  - Formatting our code correctly
  
 So we decided to use a cocktail API and propose a website to find inspiration to mix cocktails.
 I created the website design and I was in charge of the random cocktail appearing on the home page, the search bar, the search results, and the cocktail card.
 
 Some comments are mixed with french because my mates were not comfortable with english and I wanted them to understand what I coded.
 At this time we weren't aware of Context, Redux or useReducer, so states are a little all over the place :)
